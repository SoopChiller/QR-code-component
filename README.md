## My process

Sketched out rough idea of containers needed 

filled the containers with necessary content

Utilized flexbox to postion content where I needed it

styled each element one by one

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I'm trying to learn to not be "pixel perfect".

On this particular project I focused on not get hyper
focused on pixels not aligning perfectly with the example.

I had my moments but thought I was effecient and produced 
a decent outcome.

### Continued development

Continuing forward I'd love to perfect the art of the flexbox and grid.

Also would like to learn how to link some more vibrant colors to use in CSS.

Many things to work on but HTML orginization & flexbox at the top!
